## 2.3, Constants

The usual. Skipped the first two parts cause didn't really want ot need them.
This is the shit maaaan let me tell ya.

So this was something interesting. Working with converting int to char and back
and forth. A char can be broken down into numbers. Char can be converted to int,
int can be converted to char.

No matter what number you enter you can get a result of some character value.
Does this work with unicode? Does unicode provide these character numbers? How
the heck can I even use unicode in C?

Figure out how to use unicode. Right, right, right. Have to figure out a way to
do this the correct way. If you don't stop and don't have gaps, you will
remember these things, and you will move very far very quickly.

Immersed in this world. For some kind of safety and whatnot? Here it is safe,
everything is safe. World of the terminal. Twitter client. Secure, personal
twitter client using twitter API. Write it in go. What about an email client?

I think I new this already, but the reason that you can compare characters is
because they have an ascii numerical value.

Its true that you have wasted time. You don't have to make an excuse for
yourself. No need to pity yourself.

Remember that you cannot size things based on what inputs you send through,
unless you dynamically allocate the stuff.

### Enums

Defaults to settings each item in the list to some integer + 1. Can also group
other variable declataions in here.
