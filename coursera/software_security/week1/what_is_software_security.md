# Software Security
Focuses on design of software, bugs and flaws. Overlaps and complements other areas. Focused on only the code. It is white-box in the sense that it focuses on the things you can see. Black box fixes are those when you cannot see, like IT solutions.

## Why?
Software defects are often the root cause of security problems. Software security deals with it directy.
